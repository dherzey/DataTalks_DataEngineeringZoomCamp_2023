# Week 3 - Homework

## Setup
For this assignment, we will need to ingest FHV NY Taxi Data and load it into our Google Cloud Storage. We can use an orchestrator like Airflow or Prefect, or use the GCS client to load data to our bucket.

When the data is already loaded, we can create an external and an internal table in BigQuery using the FHV 2019 data.

## Question 1: 
> What is the count for fhv vehicle records for the year 2019?
